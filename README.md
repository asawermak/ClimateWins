# ClimateWins - Predicting Climate Change Consequences using Machine Learning
## Objective
#### In this project, I'll use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change at ClimateWins.

## Introduction and Company Profile
#### ClimateWins is interested in using machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and potentially the world. The organization has been sorting through data from various sources, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and other global temperature data. Machine learning will help grasp these changes comprehensively.

## Project Background
#### ClimateWins wants to assess tools to categorize and predict weather in mainland Europe, concerned with the increase in extreme weather events over the past 10-20 years. It aims to create a model for future weather predictions using historical data.

## Key Questions:
#### 1. How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?

#### 2. Are there any ethical concerns specific to this project?

#### 3. Historically, what have the maximum and minimum temperatures been?

#### 4. Can machine learning predict favorable weather conditions on a certain day?

## Context
#### Python, a widely-used programming language for machine learning, offers various models for different subjects and classifications. This project involves learning optimization and machine learning fundamentals, preparing data for analysis, performing analysis with algorithms, and deriving information from the modelsâ€™ results.

## Ethical Considerations
#### AI and machine learning are rapidly developing fields with significant ethical considerations. It's important to be aware of potential concerns, similar to how seatbelt regulations evolved over time. Machine learning elements have transformative potential, necessitating future regulation.

## Data Sets
####  a data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, covering data from the late 1800s to 2022. This data includes temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more, collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set project](https://www.ecad.eu/).
